# Overview

This repository contains my solutions for the Ethernaut challenges, implemented within the Foundry framework. Every challenge level is independently tested within its own instance on a fork of the Goerli testnet. 

Factory addresses, along with a fundamental deployment function `levelSetUp()`, can be found in the following file: [test/foundry/base/EthernautTest.sol](https://github.com/z0ld/ethernaut-foundry/blob/main/test/foundry/base/EthernautTest.sol).
